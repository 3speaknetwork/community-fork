Create a file named `.env.local` and place the given string (from starting-point) into that file.
Then run `docker-compose up` or if you want to run in background `docker-compose -d up`

After successfully running the aforementioned command, go to `localhost` or your server IP address.
You should see a fully running community page with your own community on it.

Enjoy!.
